At Red Arrow Flight Academy, we believe in the power of continuous learning and community engagement, which is why we offer our "Learning Lessons" series. These weekly online sessions provide both current students and CFI candidates with an invaluable opportunity to deepen their knowledge and prepare for various certification levels. Here's what makes these lessons a cornerstone of our training approach:

### Interactive Online Tutoring

Every week, after hours, our check instructors host a Zoom call open to all our students. This free online tutoring session is designed to tackle challenging topics and answer questions that may arise during regular training. It not only helps clarify complex aviation concepts but also keeps our students engaged and motivated.

### Community-Driven Learning

The success of "Learning Lessons" has inspired many of our CFI candidates to start their own study groups. These groups operate as micro-learning communities within our academy, where candidates collaborate and share knowledge, further solidifying their understanding and preparation for exams. This peer-led approach fosters a supportive learning environment, encouraging active participation and mutual growth.
