If you’re new to aviation and considering flight training, you might feel overwhelmed by all the terms used in the industry. At **Red Arrow Flight Academy**, located at **Doña Ana County International Jetport (KDNA)** in **Santa Teresa, NM**, we aim to make your journey into aviation as smooth as possible. This guide breaks down some common flight school terms to help you get started.

## Common Aviation Terms You Need to Know

### 1. **Part 141 vs. Part 61**
These numbers refer to different types of FAA-approved flight training programs:  
- **Part 141** programs are more structured and follow a strict FAA-approved syllabus. These programs are ideal for full-time students aiming to become professional pilots quickly.  
- **Part 61** programs are more flexible and allow students to learn at their own pace, often part-time.  

At **Red Arrow Flight Academy**, we offer both Part 141 and Part 61 programs to suit different student needs.

---

### 2. **Private Pilot License (PPL)**  
This is the first step in becoming a licensed pilot. A PPL allows you to fly a single-engine aircraft for personal use but not for hire. It’s the foundation of all other pilot certifications.  

---

### 3. **Instrument Rating (IR)**  
An instrument rating allows you to fly in low-visibility conditions, such as clouds or fog, by relying on the aircraft’s instruments. This is a critical skill for professional pilots and is available at our Santa Teresa location.

---

### 4. **AATD and BATD Simulators**
These acronyms stand for **Advanced Aviation Training Device** and **Basic Aviation Training Device**. They are flight simulators used for safe and cost-effective training. At **Red Arrow**, we use the **Redbird FMX full-motion simulator** to help students gain confidence before flying an actual airplane.

---

### 5. **Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE)**  
A DPE is an FAA-approved examiner who administers the final checkride (practical test) for pilot certifications. At Red Arrow, we have an **in-house DPE** to make the certification process more convenient for our students.

---

### 6. **Discovery Flight**
A discovery flight is a short, introductory flight with a certified instructor. It’s designed to give you a taste of flying before committing to a full training program. Discovery flights at Red Arrow are a great way to explore the skies over **Santa Teresa, El Paso, and beyond**.

---

### 7. **Flight Schedule Pro (FSP)**
FSP is an online tool for scheduling lessons and tracking your progress. All Red Arrow students use this system to stay organized throughout their training.
