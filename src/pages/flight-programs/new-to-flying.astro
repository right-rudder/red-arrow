          Our training course offering extends well beyond the PPL. No matter
          where you're starting from, our courses cater to every aspiring
          aviator's needs. We offer a range of ratings, including Private Pilot,
          Instrument Rating, Commercial Pilot, Certified Flight Instructor
          (CFI), and Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII). We also
          offer High-Performance Endorsement Training.

        <p class="pt-5">
          At Red Arrow, we prioritize hiring our own, so once you become a CFI,
          you have the opportunity for a full-time job as an instructor on our
          team to build up your flight hours. From there, you have numerous
          career options, such as flying for a regional or legacy airline, air
          freight/cargo shipping, corporate charter flying, or agricultural
          piloting. Let us guide you to success in the next phase of your pilot
          career.

        <p class="pt-5">
          As you embark on your aviation journey, understanding budget
          considerations is crucial. At Red Arrow Flight Academy, we operate on
          a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the need for down payments or
          long-term contracts. Whether you're pursuing a Private Pilot License
          or advancing to a Commercial Pilot License, we aim to provide clarity
          on the costs associated with flight training. Please note that prices
          may vary, as the duration of training can differ for each student.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-5">
          <span class="font-semibold">Financial Support:</span> We recommend exploring
          scholarship opportunities through organizations such as AOPA, EAA, and
          other aviation affinity groups. Additionally, we are partnered with Mertize
          and Stratus Financial to provide financial loan assistance. For students
          looking to pursue flight as a career while earning a university degree,
          we have a partnership with Purdue Global University offering great discounts,
          as flight training counts for university credits.

          *Military students can also leverage their Post 9-11 GI Bill® for
          flight training. However, a private pilot certificate is NOT covered
          by the Post 9-11 GI Bill®. You must hold a private certificate to
          access these benefits.
