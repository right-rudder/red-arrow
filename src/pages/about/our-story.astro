        About Red Arrow Flight Academy
      </h2>

        <p class="pt-10">
          Founded in 2013 by Tomas and Elsa Peralta, Red Arrow Flight Academy
          has evolved into a leading institution for aviation training in the
          region. We recently celebrated our 10th anniversary and are proud to
          continue as a pillar in the local aviation community of El Paso and
          Santa Teresa, leading the next generation of pilots. If youâ€™re looking
          for top-tier flight instruction, then look no further.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-5">
          Red Arrow Flight Academy takes pride in being the only flight school
          in the area equipped with an Advanced Aviation Training Device (AATD)
          Redbird Full-Motion Simulator. This state of the art simulator
          provides students with a realistic and immersive training experience,
          enhancing their skills and confidence before taking to the skies. We
          also offer a Military Rotor Transition program (RTAG), designed for
          individuals transitioning from military service to civilian flight
          training. This specialized program acknowledges the unique skills and
          experiences of military personnel, offering a seamless pathway to a
          career in aviation.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-5">
          Red Arrow Flight Academy is the sole Part 141 certified flight school
          in the region, a Cessna Pilot Training Center, an FAA Exam Center, and
          host of a Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) for Part 61 flight students.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-5">
          Our roots run deep in the local community. Founders Tomas and Elsa
          Peralta, have fostered a culture of family and support since our
          inception. Here, we feel more like a close knit family with an
          affection for aviation rather than solely a flight school. We invite
          you to the opportunity of joining the Red Arrow family!
