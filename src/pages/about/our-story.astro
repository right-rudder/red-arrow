          About Red Arrow Flight Academy
        </h2>
        <div class="text-gray-800 tracking-wider">
          <p class="pt-10">
            Founded in 2013 by Tomas and Elsa Peralta, Red Arrow Flight Academy
            has evolved into a leading institution for aviation training in the
            region. We recently celebrated our 10th anniversary and are proud to
            continue as a pillar in the local aviation community of El Paso and
            Santa Teresa, leading the next generation of pilots. If you’re
            looking for top-tier flight instruction, then look no further.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-10">
            Red Arrow Flight Academy takes pride in being the only flight school
            in the area equipped with an Advanced Aviation Training Device
            (AATD) Redbird Full-Motion Simulator. This state-of-the-art
            simulator provides students with a realistic and immersive training
            experience, enhancing their skills and confidence before taking to
            the skies. We also offer a Military Rotor Transition program (RTAG),
            designed for individuals transitioning from military service to
            civilian flight training. This specialized program acknowledges the
            unique skills and experiences of military personnel, offering a
            seamless pathway to a career in aviation.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-10">
            Red Arrow Flight Academy is the sole Part 141-certified flight
            school in the region, a Cessna Pilot Training Center, an FAA Exam
            Center, and host to a Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) for Part 61
            flight students.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-10">
            Our roots run deep in the local community. Founders Tomas and Elsa
            Peralta, have fostered a culture of inclusivity and support since
            our inception. Here, we feel more like a close-knit family with an
            affection for aviation rather than solely a flight school. We hope
            you grant us the opportunity to bring you into the Red Arrow family
            soon!
